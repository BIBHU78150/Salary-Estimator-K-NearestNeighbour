## Introduction
Salary estimation is a common application of machine learning where we predict the salary of an individual based on various features such as years of experience, education level, and other relevant factors. In this project, we use the K-Nearest Neighbors (K-NN) algorithm to perform this estimation.

## Requirements
To run this project, you will need the following libraries:
- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn

You can install these dependencies using pip:
```
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn
```
## Usage
Clone the repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/BIBHU78150/Salary-Estimator-K-NearestNeighbour.git
cd Salary-Estimator-K-NearestNeighbour
```
Upload the dataset:
The notebook includes a section to upload your dataset. Ensure your dataset is in CSV format and contains relevant features for salary estimation.

Run the notebook:
Open the notebook SalaryEstimation_K_NN.ipynb in Jupyter Notebook or any compatible environment and run all cells to train the model and make predictions.

## Project Structure
The project consists of the following sections:

Importing Libraries: Import necessary libraries for data manipulation and model building.
Loading the Dataset: Upload the dataset from your local directory.
